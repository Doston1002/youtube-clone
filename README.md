The YouTube clone is a React-based application that mimics the basic functionalities of the original YouTube platform. It includes the following key features:

Search Functionality:

A search bar at the top allows users to search for videos. This feature filters and displays relevant content based on the user's input.
Navigation Bar (Navbar):

A visually appealing navigation bar includes icons and links for categories such as "New," "Movie," "Live," "Gaming," "Education," "Sports," "Comedy," "Podcast," "Fashion," and "Crypto."
It provides a seamless way for users to explore different content genres.
Profile Section:

Space for a user profile or account icon, indicating the potential for user-specific settings, preferences, or login/logout functionality.
Home Page Design:

The main page displays sections for "New Videos," showing a grid of video thumbnails with titles, descriptions, and metadata (e.g., upload time, author name).
The layout is clean and responsive, optimized for easy browsing.
Content Cards:

Video cards include thumbnails, upload times, titles, descriptions, and other relevant metadata, giving users an overview of each video's content.
Interactivity and Responsiveness:

The application provides a user-friendly experience with hover effects, clickable links, and smooth transitions.
